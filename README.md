## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction and visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- [pandas, numpy, sklearn]

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

## Installation

### 1. Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skincare_ml.git
cd skincare_ml
```

### 2. Setting Up the Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### For macOS and Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Installing Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Activate the virtual environment** before running the code:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`

2. **Run the main script** for data processing, model training, or predictions:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Deactivate the virtual environment** when done:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
